### Exercise 1.1

Alyssa P. Hacker doesn’t see why `if` needs to be provided as a special form. “Why can’t I just define it as an ordinary procedure in terms of `cond?`” she asks. Alyssa’s friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and she defines a new version of `if`:

```Lisp
(define (new-if predicate
                then-clause
                else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))```

Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:

```Lisp
(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)```
5
```Lisp
(new-if (= 1 1) 0 5)```
0

Delighted, Alyssa uses `new-if` to rewrite the square-root program:

```Lisp
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
          guess
          (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))```

What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square roots? Explain.

`new-if` is not a special form, it is a procedure. Therefore it evaluates in applicative-order. This means it will evaluate the recursive function regardless of the predicate function result. The recursive function will kept being called and thus it will not arrive at an answer.
